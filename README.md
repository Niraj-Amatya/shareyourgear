## Problem Statement

- What

    To get started with photography a photographer not only requires to have a decent camera but plethora of accessories and lenses. For example, a typical professional level photo shoot requires a good camera body, at least two to three fast aperature lenses, a couple of lights (strobes or speed lights), light modifiers, light stands etc... Therefore it would be very costly to own all the gear when someone starts with the photography. In another use case there are situations where a specific kind of lens is required ony for specific kind of photography genre and it's not very practical to buy a new lens for one off use.
    
    In the kind of situations described above it would be very convenient to be able to get rent someone else's equipment, use and return it when done.
    
    The biggest problem is that due to the niche involved there are very few places who rent out equipment and due to the lack of competition the demand drives the prices which does not work well for small time individual photographers.
    
    Therefore it would add a lot value by creating an online platform that would bring photography community together that can help each other by sharing the gear and make some extra money.

- Why
    
    The platform needs to be online because in online space there are even less providers that encourages sharing the photography gear among the photographers. The options that exists are limited to specific camera brand, or are not two sided, or are mainly focused on big production houses or otherwise does not operate in Australia.
    
    Therefore it is important have an online platform which is brand independent and caters to individual photographers within Australia. Moreover having an online platform gives scalability to bring photography community from different locations to come together and cater to each other's photographic equipment requirements.
